**Labour Productivity Dashboard using Power BI**

## **Project Overview**

This dashboard visualizes labour productivity, efficiency, and cost performance. It was created using **Power BI**.

The dashboard provides interactive visuals for:

* Tracking worker performance

* Comparing worker types

* Monitoring weekly productivity trends

* Identifying low- and high-performing workers

* Analyzing labour cost efficiency

## **Business Objectives**

* Measure overall labour productivity

* Compare productivity across worker types

* Identify workers needing training or intervention

* Track weekly performance trends

* Optimize labour allocation and costs

## **Dataset**

The dashboard uses a processed dataset (`labour_data_with_metrics.csv`) containing:

* **Worker\_Type** — Job role (Welder, Technician, Electrician, etc.)

* **Hours\_Worked** — Hours worked

* **Output\_Units** — Units produced

* **Total\_Cost** — Total labour cost

* **Productivity** — Output per hour

* **Cost\_Per\_Unit** — Cost efficiency metric

* **Efficiency\_Score** — Performance score

* **Week** — Week number

## **Dashboard Layout**

**Section 1: KPI Summary (Top Row)**

* Total Cost

* Total Output

* Total Hours

* Average Productivity

**Section 2: Productivity by Worker Type**

* Clustered column chart showing average productivity for each worker type

**Section 3: Cost by Worker Type**

* Column chart showing total labour cost per worker type

**Section 4: Weekly Productivity Trend**

* Line chart showing productivity over time

**Section 5: Efficiency Score Distribution**

* Bar chart showing average efficiency score by worker type

**Section 6: Detailed Worker Table**

* Table of workers with key metrics and filters for low/high performance

**Section 7: Filters / Slicers**

* Interactive slicers for **Worker Type** 

## **Key Insights**

* **Top-performing worker type:** e.g., Electricians

* **Lowest-performing worker type:** e.g., Welders

* **Low performers:** X workers with efficiency score \< 70

* **High performers:** X workers with efficiency score \> 120

* Productivity trend shows improvements or declines over time

* Labour cost efficiency varies by worker type

**Recommendations:**

* Provide training to low performers

* Reward top performers

* Optimize worker allocation to improve productivity and reduce costs

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Power BI Desktop** — Dashboard creation and visualization

## **How to Use**

1. Open **Power BI Desktop**

2. Load the processed dataset: `labour_data_with_metrics.csv`

3. Open the dashboard  
4. Refresh the dataset to update visuals with the latest data

5. Use slicers to filter by worker type
